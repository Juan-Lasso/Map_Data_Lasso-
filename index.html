    <p> Manhattan boasts dozens of playgrounds dotted throughout its urban landscape, but not everyone gets equal access to play. According to the recent ACS census, there are over 200,000 disabled children aged 17 or younger in Manhattan alone. Yet, their proximity to inclusive playgrounds—those with sensory features, wheelchair accessibility, or both—can vary widely from one zip code to another. </p>
    
    <p> “Centering equity in parks for people who’ve been systematically excluded from accessing those spaces entails more than just meeting their needs; it also requires building a sense of identity and belonging,” said Wes Jenkins for the Urban Institute in a recent report. </p>
    
    <p> NYC has made noticeable strides in expanding and improving play areas to ensure disabled children can play on equal terms with their non-disabled peers. However, experts argue that a truly inclusive play space does more than attach ADA-accessible features; it reimagines how children with diverse needs engage and interact. </p>
